# Predicting Champions League Winner

## Description

This web application predicts the number of goals scored by a team in the Champions League based on various statistical parameters. It uses a linear regression model trained on a historical dataset of team performances.

## Features

- **User Input**: Users can input the team's statistical data, such as matches played, wins, draws, losses, goal difference, and points.
- **Goal Prediction**: The application uses a linear regression model to predict the number of goals scored by the team based on the input data.
- **Form Validation**: The form ensures that all fields are filled out correctly before submitting the data for prediction.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used to develop the application.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework used to build the web application.
- **Pandas**: A library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: A library used to build and train the linear regression model.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used to build the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Used for client-side form validation.
- **Render**: The platform used for deploying the application.

## How It Works

1. **Dataset Loading**: The historical dataset of team performances is loaded and preprocessed.
2. **Model Training**: A linear regression model is trained using the historical data.
3. **User Interface**: Users input the team's statistical data through a web form.
4. **Prediction**: The input data is normalized and passed to the model to get the goal prediction.
5. **Result Display**: The predicted number of goals is displayed to the user.

## Data Source

The statistical data and information can be retrieved from [FBref - Real Madrid Statistics](https://fbref.com/it/squadre/53a2f082/Statistiche-Real-Madrid).
